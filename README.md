# T-Shirt Cannon
This code is for the t-shirt cannon created by the ARCO team. Using the FRC system, we have devised a custom cannon that can be used for school event.

## Using Git

<br><br />
To clone this repository, open Git Bash in some folder on your computer/device. Then, perform the following command: `$git clone https://github.com/RishabSeshadri/ARCO-2020-made-by-the-cool-kids.git`. This will download a clone of the repository onto your device.
<br />
You can then create a repository on your account, and then push this ARCO repository code into your repository by performing the command in the same bash: `$git push <repository link>`.
<br />
If any changes to the original repository occur, you can fetch the changes by performing this command in the bash: `git fetch`.
<br />
If fetching changes does not work, you can directly pull any commits using `$git pull`.
<br><br />
To push changes to your repository, open git bash in your directory and perform a `$git add .` which will add any files that you have added to the directory to the git. Without this, your bash will not be able to access changes made in these files and hence will ignore them.
<br />
Afterwards, perform a `$git commit .` which will commit all changes made to the next push.
<br />
Since you do not want to directly push commits to the master branch, you will add a _feature_ branch if you have not done so already. This can be done by performing a `$git checkout -b feat` which places the push location (the "checkout") to a branch (-b) with the name 'feat'. Alternatively, you can return the checkout to master with `$git checkout -o master` which places the checkout at the origin (-o) with the name 'master'.
<br />
Finally, perform your `$git push` to push your changes to the specified checkout.
